OLIVER</h1><h2>CHAPTER III THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h2></div><ol><li><span class="first">1. </span>The Solar System is better known to us, as the earth on which weflourish belongs to it.</li><li><span class="first">2. </span>The System is comprised of one sun (star), eight major planets,Mercury, Venus, Earth, and one satellite, Mars and two satellites,Jupiter and seven satellites, Saturn, its rings and ten satellites,Uranus and four satellites, Neptune and one satellite, and some 600planetoids, varying in size from 600 miles in diameter to mere rocks.</li><li><span class="first">3. </span>The sun's diameter is 866,000 miles.  Rotates every 606 hours.  Thelength of time its current carries the sun over its orbit is unknown.The sun remains a melted mass; its vibration is maintained; has butlittle vapor and its theme reflected on the surface of its obsequiousattendants which gives them heat and light. Dark spots caused by vapor becomingconcentrated to the sun's surface; these spots change.</li><li><span class="first">4. </span>Mercury, the smallest major planet, also the closest to the sun.  Itis carried over its orbit about 36,000,000 miles from the sun, whichrequires 88 days to complete its course, and rotates once every 24hours and 5 minutes.  Its diameter is 3,000 miles and it has asuitable amount of vapor for animals and vegetables to flourish.</li><li><span class="first">5. </span>Venus has the brightest lustre of our planets which is caused fromenormous amount of vapor.  It is carried over its orbit at about67,000,000 miles from the sun, which requires 224 7/10 days tocomplete its course.  Rotates once every 23 hours and 21 minutes.Diameter, 7,700 miles.</li><li><span class="first">6. </span>The earth is carried over its orbit; main distance being 93,000,000miles from the sun, which requires one year to complete its course,which is 680,000,000 miles:<br><table><thead>Miles</thead><tr>	<td>Earth's diameter</td>	<td>8,000</td></tr><tr>	<td>Greater or equatorial</td>	<td>7,925</td></tr><tr>	<td>Less or polar</td>	<td>7,899</td></tr><tr>	<td>Difference on comparison</td>	<td>26</td></tr></table><br>The earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds; hasone satellite, which is carried over its orbit at a distance of238,850 miles from the earth.  Its diameter is 2,160 miles.  The mooncompletes its orbit in 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2 seconds.Its currents touch the earth and cause the tide; also affects someplants of the phenomena verita; these plants are also affected by thesun.</li><li><span class="first">7. </span>Mars is carried around the sun by its planet current at a distance of140,000,000 miles, which requires 687 days, and rotates every 24hours, 37 minutes, and 22 1/2 seconds.  Diameter, 4,200 miles.  Marshas two satellites and is not abundant in vapor which causes itsreddish appearance, therefore vegetation and animals are scanty.</li><li><span class="first">8. </span>Jupiter is the largest major planet.  It makes a great jump from thesun of 483,000,000 miles, carried by its planet current to completeits orbit in 12 years.  Rotates every 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 37seconds.  Diameter, 88,000 miles; has seven satellites.  The climatehas a very even temperature due to its fast rotation.</li><li><span class="first">9. </span>Saturn, the beauty of the skies, carried by its planet current aroundthe sun at its main distance of 883,000,000 miles (a greater distanceof 400,000,000 miles than Jupiter) which requires about 29 1/2 years.Rotates once every 10 hours, 14 minutes, and 23 seconds.  Diameter,75,000 miles.  It has ten satellites and three rings of unconcentratedmaterial.  The cape ring is about 9,000 miles across, the other twoabout 16,000 each.  Diameter of rings about 170,000 miles, which makesthe rings very close to the surface.</li><li><span class="first">10. </span>Uranus is carried by its planet current around the sun at a greatdistance of 1,778,000,000 miles, which requires about 84 years.  Rateof rotation unknown.  Diameter, 31,000 miles.  It has four satellites.</li><li><span class="first">11. </span>Neptune is the farthest from the sun.  Its main distance being2,792,000,000 miles; carried by its planet current over its orbit oncein 164 years, 9 months.  Diameter, 37,000 miles.  Period of rotationunknown.  Has one satellite.  At Neptune we haven't taken a step butour next neighbor is across the divide.  Let us have a fairy dream andtravel from the sun to Neptune in a straight or direct course at therate of 1,000,000 miles an hour; it would take us 116 1/3 days toreach Neptune.</li><li> <span class="first">12. </span>Pluto was the last planet discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.  It is 5.913 billion kilometers from the earth and has a diameter of 2,390 kilometers (about .2 earth diameters).</li></ol></body></html>
