	<h2 id="sectionHeader">Why Fallout: New Vegas?</h2>
	<p><img id="image" src="images/falloutnv.jpg" alt="Fallout: New Vegas Steam Store Image"><span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span>' story is incredibly in-depth, allowing the player to make many of their own decisions that have a substantial impact on the outcome of the game; although that is a large part of why I enjoy the game, I find the historical and pop-culture references to be thrilling. The references that the game makes to historical events encouraged me to delve deep into researching the Roman Empire long before I was instructed to do so in school. I learned a lot about World War II before we reached that section in our history classes due to my interested in seeing why a faction was functioning the way it was. The game inspired me to do much research to understand why things were the way they were. <span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span> also introduced me to pop-culture that I had been unaware of, such as <span class="title">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</span> and duck and cover educational videos and music from the 1950s and 60s. I value a lot of the music that I uncovered from <span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span>, and playing the game drove me to understand historical aspects that entertain me to this day.</p>

	<p><span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span> has had a profound effect on my life as it broadened my horizons through it's referencing to pop-culture and historical events. As a student, it helped me relate to specific historical events and pop-culture references more than I would have if I hadn't played the game. As a developer, it helped me design communities in other games that use <span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span>' lore as a basis for the gameplay as well as develop other game servers based around the lore. As a gamer, the game made me love roleplaying games with severe ethical dilemmas where it was the duty of the player character to make things right, or make things worse. Whenever I'm asked to describe what makes a video game enjoyable, I often find myself describing attributes that <span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span> has, other than it's graphics and engine. I recognize <span class="title">Fallout: New Vegas</span> as a game that solidified my love for video games and led me to desire to become a game designer and later attend college for that reason, thus, why I decided that this game would be a good topic for me to cover in a website.</p>
