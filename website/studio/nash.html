<h4><div class="yellowBack">Pretty Halcyon Days</div></h4>
<span class="verseHead">How</span> pleasant to sit on the <span class="beach">beach</span>,<br />
On the <span class="beach">beach</span>, on the sand, in the sun, <br />
With <span class="ocean">ocean</span> galore within reach,<br /> 
And nothing at all to be done!<br /> 
No letters to answer, <br />
No bills to be burned, <br />
No work to be shirked,<br /> 
No cash to be earned. <br />
It is pleasant to sit on the <span class="beach">beach</span> <br />
With nothing at all to be done.<br />
How pleasant to look at the <span class="ocean">ocean</span>,<br /><br />

<span class="verseHead">Democratic</span> and damp; indiscriminate;<br /> 
It fills me with noble emotion <br />
To think I am able to swim in it. <br />
To lave in the wave,<br /> 
Majestic and chilly, <br />
Tomorrow I crave; <br />
But today it is silly. <br />
It is pleasant to look at the <span class="ocean">ocean</span>; <br />
Tomorrow, perhaps, I shall swim in it.<br />
How pleasant to gaze at the sailors,<br /><br />

<span class="verseHead">As</span> their sailboats they manfully sail <br />
With the vigor of vikings and whalers <br />
In the days of the viking and whale. <br />
They sport on the brink <br />
Of the shad and the shark;<br /> 
If it's windy they sink;<br /> 
If it isn't, they park. <br />
It is pleasant to gaze at the sailors, <br />
To gaze without having to sail.<br />
How pleasant the salt anaesthetic<br /><br />

<span class="verseHead">Of</span> the air and the sand and the sun;<br /> 
Leave the earth to the strong and athletic, <br />
And the sea to adventure upon. <br />
But the sun and the sand <br />
No contractor can copy; <br />
We lie in the land <br />
Of the lotus and poppy; <br />
We vegetate, calm and aesthetic, <br />
On the <span class="beach">beach</span>, on the sand, in the sun.<br /><br />
