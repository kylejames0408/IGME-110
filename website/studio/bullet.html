	<h2>WHAT THE BULLET SANG</h2>
	<p>O Joy of creation<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;To be!<br>
	O rapture to fly<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;And be free!<br>
	Be the battle lost or won<br>
	Though its smoke shall hide the sun,<br>
	I shall find my love-the one<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Born for me!<br></p>

	<p>I shall know him where he stands,<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;All alone,<br>
	With the power in his hands<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Not o'erthrown;<br>
	I shall know him by his face,<br>
	By his god-like front and grace;<br>
	I shall hold him for a space<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;All my own!<br></p>

	<p>It is he-O my love!<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;So bold!<br>
	It is I-All thy love<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Foretold!<br>
	It is I. O love! what bliss!<br>
	Dost thou answer to my kiss?<br>
	O sweetheart! what is this<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Lieth there so cold?<br></p>

	Bret Harte (b.1839).
